## Introduction
Welcome to the Create DB MySQL project. In this repository, we explore the Create db dataset using SQL to perform various data manipulation tasks.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the power of MySQL in data manipulation and to gain insights from the Create db dataset.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the "Create db" dataset, containing valuable information that we've leveraged for analysis.

## Data Manipulation
Data manipulation is a key skill applied in this project. We've used MySQL to perform various operations on the dataset, extracting meaningful insights.

## Tools Used
The primary tool used for this project is MySQL, a robust relational database management system known for its data querying capabilities.

## Key Insights
Through data manipulation, we've uncovered key insights from the Create db dataset, shedding light on valuable information within.

## Queries
We've executed several SQL queries on the dataset, including:

1. Selecting last_name, first_name, points, and (points + 10) from the CUSTOMERS table.

2. Modifying Query 2 to create a discount factor and calculate (point + 10) * 100.

3. Returning all products in our database with columns: name, unit price, and a new price column calculated as (unit price * 1.1).

4. Finding all customers with a birth date greater than '1990-01-01'.

5. Querying the sql_inventory table to determine the name of the product with the most stock.

6. Querying the sql_inventory table to identify the name of the most expensive product.

7. Querying the sql_store table to discover the first name, last name, address, and birthdate of the oldest customer.

In addition to SQL queries, this project also includes the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER Diagram) for visualizing the database schema.
